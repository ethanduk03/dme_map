st.write("""According to [Medicare.gov](https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/durable-medical-equipment-dme-coverage), durable medical equipment (DME) is defined to be any equipment that is durable, intended for a medical purpose, used in your home, only useful to somebody who is sick or injured, and durable enough to last for at least 3 years. DME is covered by Medicare Part B, but only if the equipment is deemed medically necessary, and most importantly, if your doctor and/or DME suppliers are also enrolled in Medicare. After your deductible has been reached when paying for a service, if your suppliers accept assignment, then you only have to pay 20% of the remaining cost as approved by Medicare. However, if your suppliers do not accept assignment, then you may need to pay much more, and may not be able to afford the service you were getting. Therefore, knowing whether or not your doctor or supplier accepts assignment is an essential step to receiving the healthcare that you need.""")
